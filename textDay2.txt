CYPRESS INSTALLATION AND SETUP

Create one empty folder on the desktop with 'cypress automation framework'

Open the same folder on visual studio code.

Via terminal with npm init command Create package.jason file 

---------------npm init

(Package jason file is used to manage your dependencies)


---------------npm install cypress --save-dev


(To install cypress as dev dependencies and verify the file package.jason file)


NPM INSTALLATION AND UPDATE

What exactly the package.jason file do ?

1)Node_modules have all the dependencies install that we had used in our project 

2)Pratically it is not possible to share the project with node_modules folder as the 
size of the folder is very large 

3)So we ignore , node_modules folder and gave the project to other, push the project
On other the hand the person with single command 

---------------npm install 

4)All the dependencies mentioned for project in package.jason file will be downloaded.
and same ignored or deleted node_modules folder will be created.

5)To install the latest version of cypress -

---------------npm install cypress --save-dev cypress@latest

6) Cypress gives you the update with new version available
